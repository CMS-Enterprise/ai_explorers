# AI Explorers Program Pilots Initiative in OIT

This repository contains information related to the AI Explorers Program Pilots Initiative in OIT, which provided funding for CMS employee-led pilot teams to learn how artificial intelligence (AI) applications could address their business needs.

**Goals of the Pilot Initiative**

The goals of the pilot initiative are:

- Increase knowledge of AI/ML among CMS employees and help them grow their technological skill sets.
- Test AI solutions at a small scale.
- Accelerate adoption of AI/ML techniques.
- Learn how to bring an AI/ML project from ideation to production readiness within CMS.
- Develop proofs of value and initial minimum viable products.

## Pilots

Several pilots have been completed by a variety of components, such as OHC, OEDA, OIT, and others are awardees are in progress now. The previous pilots were selected based on the following evaluation criteria:

## OHC Pilot

**Use Case Description**

The aim of the OHC (Office of Human Capital) Pilot is to enhance the transparency of the hiring process and reduce recruitment effort using USA staffing and recruitment data. The goal is to develop a user-centered prototype from a raw dataset by processing the data through machine learning models and deploying the prototype in the cloud. Furthermore, the process taken to develop the solution should be repeatable and applicable to future datasets.

**Objective**

The main objective of the OHC Pilot is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to the Division's large datasets, resulting in a useful tool that meets employees' needs.

**What was Completed**

A proof-of-concept was developed, showcasing how machine learning can be applied to large datasets to meet employee needs as a useful tool.

## OEDA Pilot

**Use Case Description**

The OEDA (Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics) Pilot aims to analyze the pattern of care that leads to opioid-related hospitalization. Additionally, it aims to understand the timing of opioid type/dose amount/fill dates, timing of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), as well as potential non-time-series contributors, such as beneficiary demographics, presence of chronic conditions, and other important confounding factors.

**Objective**

The primary objective of the OEDA Pilot is to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid-related hospitalizations through data analysis.

**What was Completed**

The project was completed and provided insight into the factors that contribute to opioid-related hospitalizations.

## OIT Pilot

**Use Case Description**

The OIT (Office of Information Technology) Pilot aimed to develop an automated pipeline that provides a machine-readable Automated Technical Profile for CMS systems. The objective is to infer the technology fingerprint of CMS projects based on multiple data sources at different stages of their development lifecycle.

**Objective**

The goal of the OIT Pilot is to apply AI and data science expertise to identify opportunities in the generation of taxonomy/ontology relating to technology in use at CMS in a standard machine-readable format. Additionally, the project aimed to apply AI/natural language processing (NLP) to multiple data sources to identify matches of the technical composition of the system, and to develop a machine-readable technical profile API with relevant metadata.

**What Was Completed**

The OIT Pilot resulted in the development of a machine-readable technical profile API with relevant metadata, which included levels of confidence based on the quality of the match. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept of a recommendation engine that reduces burden was explored.

## CCSQ Pilot

**Use Case Description**

The CCSQ (Center for Clinical Standards and Quality) Pilot aimed to Modernize the validation process in Hospital Quality Reporting Program (HQRP) to avoid and prevent human errors on measure score.

**Objective**

The goal of CCSQ Pilot is to create an intelligent, automated measurement validation system based on AI/ML in Hospital Quality Reporting Program (HQRP). Additionally, the pilot aimed to improve the accuracy of this process and increase the accuracy of published data for the healthcare community by utilizing Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning techniques to detect anomalies more efficiently by looking at historical data. 

**What Was Completed**

The CCSQ Pilot resulted in the development of three machine learning models – an XGBoost model, an Isolation Forest model, and an ensemble model that both uses both XGBoost and the Isolation Forest model – that were applied to each measure to identify anomalies in the published scores for HQRP based on historical data and predicting the measure scores and predicting the measure scores. Also, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) was used to measure model performance by comparing actual measurements with predicted measurements.

## OC Pilot

**Use Case Description**

The OC (Office of Communication) Pilot aimed to identify patterns in the DevOps data to predict issues and improve developer productivity.

**Objective**

The goal of OC Pilot is to prototype an ML model that can predict the likely location of a bug using historical data in Jira stories and related code commit in GitHub.

**What Was Completed**

The OC Pilot trained and test dozens of ML models using data from CCXP and MCT to predict the folders that contain files with bugs based on text from Jira. Additionally, the pilot provided recommendations for bug report quality improvement.
