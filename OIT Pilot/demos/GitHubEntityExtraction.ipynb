    "### Ontology Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [WikiData](\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\") as our ontology knowledge base.  WikiData contains nearly 100 Million entities often linked to other knowledge bases.  For this project we are interested in software-related entities so for simplicity we will only use entities which have a StackOverflow tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretrained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a pretrained SpaCy model to extract the entities.  The `spacy-entity-linker` package is trained on the [Kensho Derived Wikimedia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenshoresearch/kensho-derived-wikimedia-data) a linked dataset between WikiData and Wikipedia hosted through Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses an alias table and max-prior method, which simply links the text mention to the entity with the most frequently used matching alias.\n",
    ">Currently the only method for choosing an entity given different possible matches (e.g. Paris - city vs Paris - firstname) is max-prior. This method achieves around 70% accuracy on predicting the correct entities behind link descriptions on wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be improved upon by training a context aware matching model but the model is sufficient for proof-of-concept.\n",
